### Overview of the OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) Guide

Hello reader, our guide on OBS is meant to help you gain basic and general skills of video recording with OBS.

The topics this guide will cover include:

- changing video and audio settings,
- adding scenes and sources,
- recording the video and saving the recording.


### How We Created Our Guide

To finish our guide, we used many different applications, documentations, and concepts. We had to learn a wide array of concepts as well as implement programs and concepts we already knew.

#### Using Markdown

The most difficult part of completing the instruction set was learning how to use the markdown and troubleshooting the issues that arose with the use of it.

In the beginning we were completely unfamiliar with the way the documentation websites are built, but as we worked more and more on the assignment - the skill just came naturally.

Markdown helped us to create an appealing documentation website that is easy to follow and eye-pleasing, and it’s apparent that the skill we’ve gained will be useful for us in the future.


#### Using Just The Docs for Styling

We were advised that the Just The Docs Jekyll theme was easy to use for this assignment, and we found that to definitely be the case. One hurdle we ran into was the website not updating after we would commit and push new changes, but simply refreshing the cache solved this problem.

#### Learning Best Practices For Web Writing

We opted to use a typography standard which helps readers distinguish between **OPTIONS**, _key terms_, and **[Keystrokes]** are mentioned in the document.

We also used the following icon to draw the user's attention to important things to note.

### Conclusion

Upon completion, every team member became more familiar with OBS and everyone is comfortable in using it when recording the videos.

We learned that if everyone does their part on time then success is inevitable. 

Throughout the process of learning how to use the markdown, we’ve learnt that helping others resolve the markdown errors actually helps us to become better in using the markdown.

Thank you for reading our introduction to OBS guide and we hope that you learned something by following through our instructions.
