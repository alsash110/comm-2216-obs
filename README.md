### Overview of Linux Instruction Guide

Hello reader, our guide on Linux is meant to provide you with a basic and general understanding of the Linux system as well as how to use basic commands to navigate and use Linux.

The things we want to teach you in this site include how to:
- navigate back and forth between directories,
- create and assign admin privileges to new user accounts,
- create, modify, move, and delete files and directories,
- find and end processes, and
- understand how Linux commands work.

### How We Collaborated Together

At the start of writing this guide, we would brainstorm our ideas in person during class for a topic as well as the essential details we would need to finish our guide. 

Due to school closure as a result of COVID-19, we did not have the chance to communicate in person and we opted to use Slack as our main form of communication outside of classes.

We kept in close contact with each other on Slack to be able to communicate effectively given our new circumstances. The quality of our work and our communication was never lowered during the entire process. We believed that _communication would be the most vital_ part in finishing and creating a high-quality document.


### How We Created Our Guide
To finish our guide, we used many different applications, documentations, and concepts. We had to learn a wide array of concepts as well as implement programs and concepts we already knew.

#### Using Markdown

The most difficult part of completing the instruction set was learning how to use the markdown and troubleshooting the issues that arose with the use of it.

In the beginning we were completely unfamiliar with the way the documentation websites are built, but as we worked more and more on the assignment - the skill just came naturally.

Markdown helped us to create an appealing documentation website that is easy to follow and eye-pleasing, and it’s apparent that the skill we’ve gained will be useful for us in the future.


#### Using Just The Docs for Styling

We were advised that the Just The Docs Jekyll theme was easy to use for this assignment, and we found that to definitely be the case. One hurdle we ran into was the website not updating after we would commit and push new changes, but simply refreshing the cache solved this problem.

#### Learning Best Practices For Web Writing

To further readability, we opted to use a typography standard which helps readers know the difference between what **OPTIONS**, _key terms_, and **[Keystrokes]** are mentioned in the document.

We also wanted to add more focus to important information by implementing icons so readers would pay more attention to certain parts of the document.

The following icon indicates the reader to please pay attention to the following.

### Conclusion

Completing a guide using many concepts and applications foreign to us was no easy feat. However, through using effective communication and collaboration tools, we were able to complete our guide with very minimal problems.

We learned that working in a group is extremely different than working alone on personal projects. The main thing we both learned was that in a group is that we all have different ideas of how things should be done or look and that these differences can cause issues.

Due to working together on this project for a month, we came to learn how the other person works and were able to easily come to agreement with each other.

Working as a group for a project was extremely beneficial to everyone involved and taught us better interpersonal skills. This project made us realize how nice working together as a group was and we enjoyed being able to work collectively as a team to create something that we are both proud of. We are looking forward to working on a project together if we are ever given the chance to.

Thank you for reading our basics to Linux guide and we hope that you learned something by following through our instructions.
