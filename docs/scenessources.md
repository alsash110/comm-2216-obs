## [](#header-3)What are scenes and sources?
A **source** is an input from which the recording will take place. OBS allows users to have many different sources of input such as a browser window, a web camera, the whole screen capture and so on.

A **scene** is the preset of sources and their positioning. Switching between scenes allows the user to make different layouts of screen inputs in a single video.

Once you’ve selected your audio and video sources, you’re ready to start setting up what you’ll be recording. At the bottom of your OBS window you’ll find a box that says **SOURCES**. Click on the **‘+’** to add a new source. 

You’ll be greeted with this menu:

From here you’ll select the sources you want to capture. Once you’ve selected the sources, they’ll show up in the sources box. We’ll go over next which sources you will need to start your first recording or stream

If you’re using OBS for streaming video games or recording lectures or tutorials, you’ll likely want to capture some combination of the sources listed below. Outlined below are what each of these capture modules will be recording.
