# Choosing Scenes and Sources
{: .no_toc }

<h2>What are scenes and sources?</h2>
A source is an input from which the recording will take place. OBS allows users to have many different sources of input such as a browser window, a web camera, the whole screen capture and so on.

A scene is the preset of sources and their positioning. Switching between scenes allows the user to make different layouts of screen inputs in a single video.

## What is Video's Frame Rate

Frame rate is the rate that represents how frequently the image is being changed on the display of your computer. Itâ€™s usually measured in frames per second, or FPS. So if a video is captured and played back at 60fps, that means each second of video shows 60 distinct still images.

Frame rate affects how smooth the video is for human eye. If a video has an FPS of over 24, that video would look smooth to most humans.
