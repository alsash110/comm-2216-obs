# Audio Setup
Correctly setting up the audio is important in ensuring that the video sounds exactly as it should. If you're speaking, but there's background noise which is too loud, the viewer may miss important chunks of information.

To tinker with the audio, first we'll need to get to the **AUDIO** section of the **SETTINGS**.

1) Navigate to the **SETTINGS** menu from the **CONTROLS** section in the bottom right hand corner of the window

2) Move to the **AUDIO** tab

In the **AUDIO** tab, you'll find many options related to adjusting sounds, but many of these can be ignored. The important area from here, however, is the *Devices* section, pointed out in the image below, with the two main components grouped out.

You'll notice that there are two types of audio here: *Desktop Audio* and *Mic/Auxiliary Audio*.

You can think of the *Desktop Audio* as the output audio, meaning devices which are playing audio from your computer (headphones, speakers, etc.). The *Mic/Auxiliary Audio*, on the other hand, is the input audio. This is any audio that you are providing the computer, like a microphone, and also includes things such as a piano keyboard being plugged in.

By default, both *Desktop Audio* and *Mic/Auxiliary Audio* will be set to *default*, which means that it will use your computer’s default output and input devices. If your audio is not being recorded properly, you may need to select a different device from the dropdown menu. Below is an image of an example dropdown menu from the “desktop audio” option.

>>**NOTE**: Input and output devices vary from computer to computer, and as such, your computer will likely have different devices listed.
