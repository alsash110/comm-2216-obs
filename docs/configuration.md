# Video Setup
{: .no_toc }


Setting up the video to record is one of the most important aspects of your video recording process. One of the key factors to consider when recording it is the quality of the video.

The main factors that affect the visual quality of a video are _framerate_ (measured in frames per second) and the _resolution_ (the amount of pixels used to capture/replicate an image on the screen).

One of the reasons why OBS is so popular, is because it allows you to control these quality settings.

## Setting Videoâ€™s Framerate and Resolution

In order to set the frame rate and resolution of the video you want to record, follow the next steps.

---


**1) Open SETTINGS from CONTROLS tab**

**2) Click on VIDEO tab**

**3) Make sure that the values of Base Resolution, Output Resolution, Downscale Filter and FPS values fit you.**

If you want to record a video of worse quality that takes up less memory on your computer - lower the resolution and framerate.
If you want to record a video of better quality but that takes up more memory on your computer - increase the resolution and framerate.

You now know how to change the framerate, and the resolution of your recordings. 

Now you will be able to change them if you want to increase or decrease the video quality to adjust quality/memory ratio.

The next step of recording a great video is setting up the audio.
