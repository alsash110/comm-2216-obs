### Is This Guide For You

This guide provides basic information for users who are new to using OBS.

This document will provide the OBS user with very basic information on how to record a simple video. The document will also make the user more familiar with helper functions of OBS such as Filters and Transitions.

This guide will not cover setting up streaming, though many parts of this guide, such as scenes and sources, can be applicable to streaming in OBS.


### Software Requirements

This guide uses OBS version 26.1.1 on a 64-bit machine running Windows 10, though OBS also has versions usable on macOS and Linux.

To download OBS, go to https://obsproject.com/download.

### Prerequisites

To follow this document, the user needs the following:

1. Have access to a computer, mouse and keyboard

2. Enough free space on computer disk for the recording

3. A general understanding of using their computer

4. _Optional:_ A microphone

5. _Optional:_ A web camera.


### Why Use OBS

OBS is a very simple-to-use piece of software, which can be used to record videos or stream to certain websites. However, its interface can be daunting and intimidating, leading to many people using other free recording software. 

If you get past that initial impression and begin to use OBS, then you’ll find that it has a clear edge over other free recording software, as it doesn’t feature any watermarking or recording time limit that many others do.

### Conclusion

Learning the basics of OBS would be a useful skill for a person who works remotely and wants to record quality video reports. No more low-resolution, low FPS, uninteractive video reports - with OBS you can control almost everything. 

That being said, OBS is designed to help the user to get to recording quickly. But before recording a video, one should first have that video setup.
